EJ Wong: 
I have added a source code that calculates a running average across a selected timeframe and a second algorithm that runs the greatest average output over a specific timeframe. The second algoritm is similar to Kadane's Algorithm but uses an maximum average subarray of size n compared to just a max subarray.

Please see [`codeWong.py`](src/codeWong.py). 

Reproducable code can be done here:

```
make wong
```
